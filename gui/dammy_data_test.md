You can see the operation screen with the GUI alone.

You can display the topology diagram of dummy data by deleting the  the following line comment // in the config file.
Since it only reads dummy data, you can not actually operate the controller.


- js/config.js
~~~console
//              NOT_CONNECT_TO_SERVER: true,
//              USE_DUMMY_DATA: true,
~~~
